# Momentum Trading Bot

A modular momentum-trading system built in Go with a React operator dashboard. The full quant stack includes intraday alpha signals (OFI, VPIN, OBV, ORB, dollar bars), VaR/CVaR risk management, GARCH volatility forecasting, mean-variance optimization, risk parity portfolio construction, VWAP/TWAP execution algorithms, an ML inference pipeline with meta-labeling and ensemble scoring, a weekly auto-optimizer with guardrails and hot-reload, backtesting with walk-forward/CPCV validation, and live paper/real trading via the Alpaca Markets API.

> **Alpaca paid subscription required** — the bot uses the SIP data feed for real-time and historical market data.

## Features

### Intraday Alpha Signals
- **Order Flow Imbalance (OFI)** — real-time buy/sell aggression measurement with anti-spoofing persistence filter
- **VPIN** — Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading for flow toxicity detection
- **OBV Divergence** — On-Balance Volume divergence detection (bullish/bearish)
- **Dollar Bars / Volume Bars** — volume-clock sampling for ML feature engineering
- **Opening Range Breakout (ORB)** — with gap filter and volume confirmation
- **Signal Aggregator** — combines multiple signal sources with configurable weights

### Trading Engine
- **Two-Path Momentum Scanner** — scans for candidates via two independent paths:
  - **Path 1: Gap Scanner** — traditional overnight gap filter (`MinGapPercent`), relative volume, premarket volume
  - **Path 2: HOD Momo Scanner** — detects intraday momentum runners (stocks up `HODMomoMinIntradayPct`%+ from open with high relative volume), bypasses gap and premarket volume requirements. Catches stocks like ANNA that gap small but run 50-100% intraday.
  - Both paths share price, float, and HOD proximity filters
  - New `hod_breakout` setup type when price is within 1% of session high with strong intraday move
  - New `hod_pullback` setup type when price is between `HODMomoMaxDistFromHigh` and `HODMomoPullbackMaxDist` of HOD — catches pullback entries on momentum runners (e.g., ANNA 7.3% below HOD)
  - HOD momo qualified stocks bypass the general `MaxDistanceFromHighPct` filter
- **Scanner Filters** — price, float (`MaxFloat`/`MinFloat`), minimum daily volume (`MinPrevDayVolume`), HOD proximity, RSI overbought/oversold
- **Dual-Direction Strategy** — long breakouts/pullbacks, short breakdowns
- **Four Playbook Types** — Breakout, Pullback, Continuation, Reversal — each with its own exit parameters
- **Market Regime Detection** — threshold-based (default) and HMM regime detector
- **Confidence-Based Entry Scoring** — with regime gating and ML score integration
- **Improved Diagnostics** — candidate rejection reasons include `market-closed`, `regime-gated`, `past-entry-deadline`, `cooldown`, `same-side-today`, `loss-cooldown` (replaces generic `no-signal`)

### Risk Management
- Portfolio heat tracking with alert thresholds
- Graduated daily loss response (moderate / severe / halt tiers)
- Sector concentration limits (max positions + exposure per sector; stocks with unknown/empty GICS sector bypass sector limits)
- Correlation-aware position approval
- Kelly Criterion position sizing
- Volatility-target position sizing (with configurable max vol estimate clamp via `MaxVolEstimate`)
- Position size floor (`MinPositionNotionalPct`) — prevents vol-target from sizing momentum positions to near-zero
- Defensive stops for broker-seeded positions — on restart, existing broker positions automatically get stop prices computed from the previous day's low (via Alpaca snapshots) or a configurable ATR fallback percentage (`EntryATRPercentFallback`), ensuring no position is ever unprotected
- Drawdown-based risk reduction (linear scale to max acceptable drawdown)
- Per-minute entry throttle (`MaxEntriesPerMinute`)
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** — parametric and historical simulation
- **Conditional VaR (CVaR / Expected Shortfall)**
- **Intraday VaR limit monitoring**
- **GARCH(1,1) volatility forecasting**
- **Dynamic risk budgeting** with volatility-targeted sizing

### Portfolio Construction
- **Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz)** with Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage
- **Risk Parity** with EWMA volatility tracking
- **Factor-Neutral construction** (beta hedging vs SPY)
- **HHI diversification metric** with concentration alerts
- **Long-Short balancing** (dollar-neutral, beta-neutral, sector-neutral)

### Execution Optimization
- **Exit order retry with widening slippage** — exit orders (close/partial) retry up to 5 times with progressively wider limit price slippage (1x → 3x → 5x → 8x → 12x). Market orders are never used — limit-only for pre/post-market compatibility and price control. Entry orders are not retried (missing an entry is acceptable).
- **VWAP execution** — volume-profile-weighted order slicing
- **TWAP execution** — equal time-slice distribution
- **Adaptive limit pricing** — auto-widening with max slippage control
- **Execution router** — auto-selects VWAP/TWAP/direct based on order size
- Almgren-Chriss market impact model
- Percentage-based slippage model (liquid / mid / illiquid tiers)

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Feature engineering** — 20+ causal, stationary features
- **Fractional differentiation** for stationarity preservation
- **Pure-Go inference engine** (linear models + gradient-boosted stumps)
- **Meta-labeling** with triple barrier method (wired into strategy)
- **ML scoring** with confidence threshold (wired into strategy)
- **Ensemble methods** (equal weight, IR-weighted, regime-conditional)
- **Concept drift detection** (PSI + rolling Sharpe decay)

### Trade Management
- RSI overbought/oversold filter
- Time-of-day adaptive parameters with configurable midday score multiplier
- **Entry deadline** — block new entries after configurable minutes from open (e.g., 120 min = 2 hours)
- **Risk/reward pre-check** — reject trades where estimated reward < configurable R:R ratio × risk
- Partial exit framework (two trigger levels with configurable percentages) — partial exits use a distinct `IntentPartial` intent that correctly routes to `ReducePosition` instead of `ClosePosition`
- Adaptive trailing stops with volatility factor
- Mean-reversion overlay (Bollinger bands + ADX filter)

### Scanner Quality Filters
- **HOD proximity filter** — longs must be within configurable % of high of day (buying strength, not catching knives)
- **Volume-on-pullback scoring** — decreasing volume on pullback candles = score bonus; increasing volume = penalty (distribution detection)

### Backtesting & Validation
- Backtest engine with streaming bar iterator (memory efficient)
- Monte Carlo simulation (configurable number of sims)
- Bootstrap significance testing
- Transaction cost model (commissions, SEC/TAF fees, spread costs)
- Deflated Sharpe Ratio
- Walk-forward analysis (in-sample / out-of-sample with purge gap)
- CPCV — Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation
- **Bonferroni correction** for multiple hypothesis testing
- **Benjamini-Hochberg FDR** procedure
- Integrated MHT corrections with optimizer output

### Optimization
- Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) grid search
- Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Process surrogate + Expected Improvement
- Sensitivity analysis
- Four strategy profiles: `baseline_breakout`, `high_conviction_breakout`, `continuation_breakout`, `momentum_cameron`
- Optimizer artifact output with promotion workflow (paper → live)

### Auto-Optimizer
- Weekly automatic optimization (Saturday 6 AM ET)
- Guardrail validation (Sharpe, win rate, drawdown, trade count, DSR, improvement)
- Automatic profile promotion with atomic file writes and backups
- Hot-reload — live bot picks up new profile without restart
- Telegram notifications for optimizer events

### Dashboard

## Bugfixes

### Exit Orders Not Retried on Timeout (Fixed)
When selling to exit a losing position, if the 30-second poll timeout fired, the order was cancelled and the function returned — no retry. The position stayed open and continued losing. The fix implements a 5-attempt retry with progressively wider limit price slippage for all exit orders (close and partial intents): attempt 1 uses normal slippage, then 3x → 5x → 8x → 12x on subsequent retries. Market orders are never used — aggressive limit orders guarantee fills while maintaining price control and working during pre/post-market hours. Entry orders remain single-attempt (missing an entry is acceptable).

### Thinly Traded Stocks Passing Scanner (Fixed)
The scanner had `MinRelativeVolume` and `MinPremarketVolume` filters but no absolute daily volume floor. A stock with 10,000 shares/day average but 5x relative volume (50,000 shares) would pass — but it's far too thinly traded for momentum trading (wide spreads, no liquidity, can't exit). The fix adds `MinPrevDayVolume` config field (`0` = disabled in default profile, `500000` in momentum_cameron) and filters in the scanner's `evaluate()` and `classifyTickRejection()`. Previous day volume of 0 (unknown) is passed through, not blocked.

### Broker-Seeded Positions Missing Stop Prices (Fixed)
When the bot restarts, existing broker positions are seeded via `SeedBrokerPosition()` but had `StopPrice=0`, `RiskPerShare=0`, `EntryATR=0`, `OriginalQuantity=0`, and `Playbook=""`. This meant after a restart, positions were unprotected — no stop-losses, no trailing stops, no partial exits — until the end-of-day forced exit at 3:45 PM. The fix runs two passes after broker position seeding: first, a snapshot-based pass uses the previous day's low/high as natural support/resistance for stop placement; second, a percentage-based fallback (`EntryATRPercentFallback` or 2% default) ensures every position gets a stop. The strategy also gained a defensive `stop-loss-fallback` check that fires if a position somehow reaches exit evaluation with `StopPrice=0`. This is transparent — no configuration changes needed.

### Partial Exits Closing Full Position (Fixed)
`NormalizeIntent("partial")` was mapped to `"close"`, causing partial exit signals to fully close positions instead of reducing them. The fix introduces a distinct `IntentPartial` constant and updates `NormalizeIntent` to preserve partial intent. The backtest engine also no longer deletes per-trade analytics on partial exits, so MFE/MAE tracking continues through the remainder of the position.

### Sector Concentration Blocking Small-Cap Entries (Fixed)
The `SectorForSymbol()` lookup uses a hardcoded map of ~100 large-cap tickers. Any stock not in the map gets sector `"unknown"`. With `MaxPositionsPerSector = 2`, after entering 2 small-cap momentum stocks (all `"unknown"` sector), every subsequent entry was blocked. The fix skips the sector concentration check when sector is `"unknown"` or empty. The check still applies for well-known stocks with known GICS sectors.

### Closed Trades Lost on Restart (Fixed)
The dashboard's "Trades" page was empty after a bot restart because closed trades were only held in-memory. The `closedTrades` slice in the portfolio manager started empty on each boot, even though trades had been written to Postgres (or the filesystem JSONL fallback) via `RecordClosedTrade()`. The fix adds `LoadTodayClosedTrades()` to both storage backends and `SeedClosedTrades()` to the portfolio manager. On startup, today's closed trades are loaded from storage and seeded into the portfolio manager, restoring the trade history, day PnL, and trade count. This is transparent — no configuration changes needed.

### Live Trading Normalizer Cold-Start (Fixed)
On a fresh live/paper start the normalizer had no historical state: `previousClose=0`, `prevDayVolume=0`, `preMarketVol=0`. This caused `GapPercent=0`, `RelativeVolume=1.0`, and `PreMarketVolume=0` for every symbol, which meant ALL stocks failed the scanner's `MinGapPercent`, `MinRelativeVolume`, and `MinPremarketVolume` filters — producing zero trades. The fix seeds the normalizer from the Alpaca multi-symbol snapshot API (`/v2/stocks/snapshots`) on startup, providing yesterday's close/volume and today's open/high/volume before the first bar arrives. This is transparent — no configuration changes needed. The SIP data feed (paid Alpaca subscription) is required for snapshots.

### WebSocket Streaming (Fixed)
The live bot previously only handled `b` (minute bar) messages from the Alpaca WebSocket, silently ignoring subscription confirmations, errors, updated bars, and daily bars. This caused zero visibility into streaming health and missed data corrections.

**Now handles all Alpaca WebSocket message types:**
- `b` — Minute bars (primary data source, routed to normalizer)
- `u` — Updated bars (late trade corrections, routed to same pipeline as minute bars)
- `d` — Daily bars (cumulative session OHLCV, updates normalizer high-of-day and volume)
- `t` — Trades (counted for stats; future: real-time price updates)
- `subscription` — Subscription confirmations with symbol counts logged
- `error` — Alpaca errors (e.g., symbol limit exceeded) logged with code and message
- `success` — Auth confirmations

**Debug logging:** Stream stats (bars, updated bars, daily bars, trades, errors, drops) are logged every 60 seconds. First bar received is logged with symbol, time, price, and volume. Subscribe batches are logged individually.

**Daily bars subscription:** The bot now subscribes to `dailyBars` alongside `bars` for all symbols. Daily bar updates feed the normalizer with running session high-of-day and cumulative volume, improving scanner accuracy between minute bar emissions.

**JSON parsing fix:** Added explicit `Type` field (`json:"T"`) to `StreamBar` struct to prevent Go's case-insensitive JSON decoder from confusing the `"T"` (message type) and `"t"` (timestamp) fields.

## Quant Research

The system's quantitative methodologies are documented in the comprehensive research document:

- **Section 2** — Risk Management (Kelly, VaR/CVaR, drawdown, correlation, HMM/GARCH, dynamic risk budgeting)
- **Section 3** — Portfolio Construction (Markowitz MVO, risk parity, factor-neutral, HHI, L/S balancing)
- **Section 4** — Execution Optimization (VWAP, TWAP, Almgren-Chriss, adaptive limit pricing)
- **Section 5** — Statistical Validation (walk-forward, CPCV, MHT corrections, DSR, regime-conditional backtesting)
- **Section 6** — Machine Learning (feature engineering, XGBoost/LightGBM, online learning, meta-labeling, ensembles)
- **Section 7** — Implementation Priorities & Integration Notes

Each section includes formulas, implementation guidance, key parameters, and academic references.

## Auto-Optimizer

The auto-optimizer runs as a sidecar process that automatically tunes trading parameters on a weekly schedule.

### How It Works

1. **Saturday 6 AM ET** — fetches the last 3 months of market data from Alpaca
2. Runs the full optimizer (LHS grid search + Bayesian optimization)
3. Validates the candidate against guardrails:
   - Sharpe ratio ≥ 0.5
   - Win rate ≥ 30%
   - Max drawdown ≤ 20%
   - At least 20 trades
   - DSR > 0.50
   - Must improve on current profile by ≥ 10% (configurable)
4. If all checks pass: backs up the current profile and writes the new one
5. The live bot detects the file change within 10 seconds and hot-reloads the config
6. Sends Telegram notification with metrics summary

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Default: weekly schedule, update profiles/default.json
go run . auto-optimize -profile profiles/default.json

# Run immediately, then continue on schedule
go run . auto-optimize -profile profiles/default.json -now

# Run a single optimization and exit (no scheduling loop)
go run . auto-optimize -profile profiles/default.json -once

# Daily schedule with custom guardrails
go run . auto-optimize -profile profiles/default.json -schedule daily -min-sharpe 0.7 -min-winrate 0.35

# All flags
go run . auto-optimize \
  -profile profiles/default.json \
  -schedule weekly \
  -out .cache/optimizer \
  -min-sharpe 0.5 \
  -min-winrate 0.30 \
  -max-drawdown 0.20 \
  -require-improvement \
  -max-symbols 500 \
  -now \
  -once
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-profile` | Path to the active profile to update | `profiles/default.json` |
| `-schedule` | Schedule: `weekly` or `daily` | `weekly` |
| `-out` | Optimizer output directory | `.cache/optimizer` |
| `-min-sharpe` | Minimum Sharpe ratio (profit factor) | `0.5` |
| `-min-winrate` | Minimum win rate | `0.30` |
| `-max-drawdown` | Maximum drawdown percentage | `0.20` |
| `-require-improvement` | Require improvement over current profile | `true` |
| `-max-symbols` | Maximum symbols for optimization (0=unlimited) | `500` |
| `-now` | Run optimization immediately, then continue on schedule | `false` |
| `-once` | Run a single optimization and exit (no scheduling loop) | `false` |

### Docker

The auto-optimizer runs automatically as a sidecar in Docker Compose with the `-now` flag, so it runs an immediate optimization on startup and then continues on the weekly schedule. Both the bot and optimizer share the `profiles/` volume, so promoted profiles are picked up via hot-reload.

```bash
docker compose up -d  # starts postgres + bot + auto-optimizer
```

## Telegram Notifications

The auto-optimizer can send notifications to a Telegram chat when it starts, completes, promotes a profile, or rejects a candidate.

### Setup

1. Create a Telegram bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get the bot token
2. Send a message to your bot, then get your chat ID from `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF...
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=987654321
   ```

Notifications are optional — if the env vars are not set, the optimizer runs silently (logs only).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+
- Node.js 22+ (for dashboard)
- PostgreSQL 16+ (optional — falls back to filesystem storage)
- Alpaca Markets account with paid subscription (SIP data feed required)

### Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwintcloud/momentum-trading-bot.git
cd momentum-trading-bot
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Alpaca API keys

# Build dashboard
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Live paper trading
go run . live

# Backtest (auto-fetches bars from Alpaca, cached to .cache/bars/)
go run . backtest -start 2025-01-01 -end 2025-03-01

# Backtest with debug output for specific symbols
go run . backtest -start 2025-01-01 -end 2025-03-01 -debug AAPL,TSLA

# Backtest from local CSV
go run . backtest -start 2025-01-01 -end 2025-03-01 -data path/to/bars.csv

# Optimization
go run . optimize -as-of 2025-06-01

# Optimization with explicit start and max symbols
go run . optimize -as-of 2025-06-01 -start 2025-01-01 -max-symbols 200

# Auto-optimizer (runs on schedule)
go run . auto-optimize -profile profiles/default.json

# Clear bar cache
go run . backtest -start 2025-01-01 -clear-cache
```

> The backtest and optimize commands automatically fetch historical data from Alpaca. The `-symbols` flag is **not** required — the system discovers symbols automatically. Data is cached to `.cache/bars/` for fast subsequent runs.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Alpaca API keys

docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL + the bot + the auto-optimizer. The `.cache` directory is mounted as a volume so cached data persists across container restarts. The auto-optimizer runs as a sidecar with `-now` for an immediate first optimization, then continues on the weekly schedule. It shares the `profiles/` volume with the bot for seamless hot-reload. Dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`.

| `FLOAT_DATA_URL` | URL or file path to CSV with `symbol,float` per line | (optional) |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token for notifications | (optional) |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Telegram chat ID for notifications | (optional) |

> Alpaca paid subscription is required for the SIP data feed. The live-trading arming flag is intentional — the bot refuses to start in live mode unless `ALPACA_LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true`.

Control-plane access:
- The dashboard, `/api/*`, and `/ws` require HTTP Basic auth (username: `operator`, password: `CONTROL_PLANE_AUTH_TOKEN`)
- `GET /healthz` and `GET /readyz` stay public for probes

### Trading Profile

The bot uses versioned JSON trading profiles stored in `profiles/`. Four strategy profiles are supported:

| Profile | Description |
|---|---|
| `baseline_breakout` | Default balanced profile |
| `high_conviction_breakout` | Higher conviction, fewer trades |
| `continuation_breakout` | Continuation-focused entries |
| `momentum_cameron` | Ross Cameron-inspired momentum day trading (long-only, strict filters) |

- Profile loaded from `TRADING_PROFILE_PATH` env var or bundled `profiles/default.json`
- `TuneTradingConfig()` fills any missing fields with sensible defaults based on broker equity and plan limits
- See `profiles/default.json` for the full ~125 config fields

### Key Config Categories

**Core Risk** — `RiskPerTradePct`, `DailyLossLimitPct`, `MaxTradesPerDay`, `MaxOpenPositions`, `MaxExposurePct`, `MaxEntriesPerMinute`

**Scanner** — `MinPrice`, `MaxPrice`, `MinGapPercent`, `MinRelativeVolume`, `MinPremarketVolume`, `MinATRBars`, `MaxFloat`, `MinFloat`, `MinPrevDayVolume`, `FloatOverrideURL`

**Trade Management** — `TrailActivationR`, `ProfitTargetR`, `PartialExitsEnabled`, `EntryStopATRMultiplier`, `TrailATRMultiplier`, `TightTrailTriggerR`, `EntryDeadlineMinutesAfterOpen`, `MinRiskRewardRatio`, `MidDayScoreMultiplier`

**Scanner Quality** — `MaxDistanceFromHighPct`, `VolumeOnPullbackEnabled`

**HOD Momo Scanner** — `HODMomoEnabled` (default: false), `HODMomoMinIntradayPct` (10%), `HODMomoMinRelativeVolume` (5x), `HODMomoMaxDistFromHigh` (5% — breakout range), `HODMomoPullbackMaxDist` (10% — pullback range), `HODMomoMinMinutesSinceOpen` (5 min). Enabled in `momentum_cameron` profile.

**Position Sizing** — `MinPositionNotionalPct` (0 = disabled, 0.02 = 2% of equity floor), `MaxVolEstimate` (5.0 = cap annualized vol at 500%)

**Quant Features** — enable/disable flags for each feature: `EnableMarketRegime`, `KellySizingEnabled`, `VolTargetSizingEnabled`, `CorrelationCheckEnabled`, `FactorAnalysisEnabled`, `ImpactModelEnabled`, `HMMRegimeEnabled`

**Optimization** — `OptimizerSamples`, `OptimizerUseLHS`, `BayesianOptEnabled`, `WalkForwardEnabled`, `CPCVEnabled`

See `profiles/default.json` for the complete field reference.

### Momentum Cameron Profile

The `momentum_cameron` profile implements Ross Cameron's momentum day trading methodology combined with the bot's quant infrastructure. It is designed for small accounts ($25k) focused on high-probability intraday momentum trades.

**Key differences from `baseline_breakout`:**
- **Strict stock selection** — MaxPrice $20 (vs $200), MinRelativeVolume 5x (vs 2x), MinGapPercent 5% (vs 3%), float filter (500k–20M shares), MinPrevDayVolume 500K (rejects thinly traded stocks)
- **Long-only** — shorts disabled; Cameron's edge is exclusively long-biased
- **Morning-only** — entry deadline 120 minutes after open; midday score multiplier 2x
- **Conservative risk** — 1% risk per trade, max 6 trades/day, max 3 open positions, 2:1 minimum R:R requirement
- **Tighter exits** — Breakout target 2.5R (vs 4.0R), faster trailing stops, partial exits at 1R (50%) and 2R (25%)
- **HOD Momo scanner enabled** — catches intraday momentum runners that gap small but run 50-100%+ from open (e.g., ANNA 2026-03-20), with pullback entries up to 10% from HOD
- **Vol-target sizing disabled** — momentum trading IS about volatile stocks; risk-per-trade % and ATR stops control risk instead
- **Position size floor** — `MinPositionNotionalPct=2%` prevents vol estimates from crushing position sizes to near-zero
- **Momentum signals enabled** — OFI, VPIN, ORB, OBV divergence for order flow confirmation
- **Portfolio construction disabled** — MVO, risk parity, factor-neutral off (not applicable for 1–3 position momentum)
- **ML disabled** — until models are trained on momentum-specific data

**Usage:**
```bash
TRADING_PROFILE_PATH=profiles/momentum_cameron.json go run . live
```

**Recommended for:** small accounts ($25k), momentum day trading, paper trading validation before live deployment.
